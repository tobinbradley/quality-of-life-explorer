## Population - Older Adult
Percentage of the population age 65 and over

### Why is this important?   
The number of adults age 65 and over continues to rise as the large "Baby Boomer" generation (those born between 1946 and 1964) reaches retirement age. As this generation ages, neighborhoods can experience large demographic changes over short periods of time. Shifts in the older adult population can change demand for recreational and social service programs, transit and para-transit, neighborhood infrastructure, health care, and housing types that both remain affordable on fixed incomes and allow aging in place. 

#### How are we doing?
The older adult population in Mecklenburg County was 10.9% in 2019, significantly lower than North Carolina (15.9%) and the United States (15.6%). At 35.1 years, Mecklenburg County has the youngest median age in the 14-county Charlotte region. However, the number of older adults continues to rise *and* rise more quickly: Annual growth of the older adult population was 3% per year from 2000 to 2010 (59,724 to 81,113); Mecklenburg County had more than 117,000 older adults in 2019.

Note: In order to make equal comparisons to the smaller areas, the values for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina and the United States in the previous paragraph are also from the American Community Survey 5-Year estimates. While more current 1-year estimates are available for the larger areas, it is important to use the most precise and most comparable 5-year estimates. [Click here]( http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html/) to learn more on the difference between 1-and 5-year estimates.

#### Did you know?
According to a study from the AARP, the amenities that older adults prefer to have close to home (within one mile) are bus stops, grocery stores, parks, and pharmacies.
