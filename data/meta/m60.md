## Disorder-related Calls
Disorder-related calls per 1,000 residents

### Why is this important?
Disorder-related offenses, such as public intoxication, fighting, disturbing the peace and drug possession, adversely impact the health and safety of residents. While disorder and crime are not directly linked, the presence of disorder in a community may lead to increased fear and withdrawal from residents, which may then allow more serious crime to move in because of decreased levels of social control. 

Tracking disorder-related calls can assist neighborhoods and residents in identifying repeated problems and developing strategies to address them. Increases in number of calls may signify increased disorder or show signs of increased neighborhood engagement and concern. Spikes in the number of disorder-related calls may also reflect special events, such as street festivals or sporting events.

#### How are we doing?
Suspicious person or vehicle is the number one disorder-related type call. Disorder-related calls have been steadily decreasing since 2016 when police received 121,520 calls.
