## High School Graduation Rate
Percentage of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) students graduating high school in 4 years

### Why is this important?
Graduation rates play a fundamental role in individual and community well-being - high school graduates have more opportunities for continued education, higher lifelong earnings, and better health outcomes, and communities with more-educated residents have greater productivity and economic growth. Since these data are based on where students live, regardless of what school they attend, they may help identify areas where community-based services and resources are needed to support student success.  

Student achievement is impacted by much more than school quality. Research has identified critical factors for high school graduation including school readiness, early literacy, grade level proficiency, middle school and high school transition, attendance, student behavior, family involvement, and presence of caring adult relationships.


#### How are we doing?
In 2018-2019, the 4-year cohort graduation rate in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) was 89%, up from a low of 66% in 2009. The 2019 CMS rate is similar to the United States (83%) and North Carolina (86%), compares favorably to other urban school districts such as Atlanta (72%), but falls short of the 90% graduation rate, a goal set by national and local leaders.   

#### Did you know? 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, adults with a high school diploma earn $775 more per month than those who do not have a high school diploma. 

### About the Data
Number of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) students that graduate high school in 4 years, using 4-year cohort data. 

A cohort refers to a high school class and is calculated by: students who entered ninth grade in a particular year, plus students who transferred into the district in the grade appropriate to the cohort, minus students who transferred out of the district or are deceased. Drop-out students count as non-graduates unless they later enroll in another school and graduate on time. Students who receive a GED are not counted as high school graduates for these calculations. CMS data are based on the home location of the student, regardless of which school they attend. Areas with fewer than 5 students are suppressed and represented as N/A. Students attending charter schools, private schools, or home schools are not included in CMS data.

Note: The year displayed is the year in which the school year ended (e.g. "2019" reflects information from the 2018-2019 school year).
