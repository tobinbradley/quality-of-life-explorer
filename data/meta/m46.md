## Proximity to a Pharmacy
Percentage of housing units within &#189;-mile of a pharmacy

### Why is this important?
Pharmacists serve as an "in-the-community" resource for health and medication information, and may also offer acute health care clinics for basic immunizations and the treatment of minor illness. In addition, prescription drugs dispensed at pharmacies allow large numbers of people to control chronic disease and disability, improving individual and community health. Proximity to a pharmacy is only one aspect of accessibility. Other factors that affect access are cost and health insurance coverage, hours of operation, wait time, transportation, cultural/language barriers, and geographic barriers such as major highways.

#### Did you know?
There were 202 pharmacies in Mecklenburg County in 2021, down from 213 in 2016. These include independent pharmacies, chain pharmacies, and pharmacies located within grocery and chain stores and super stores. Even though the data show a small decrease in the total number of pharmacies, the data for households that are proximate to a pharmacy remains constant at 34% from 2016 to 2021.
