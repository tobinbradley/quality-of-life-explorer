### Why is this important?
Libraries foster literacy and learning, provide an open civic space, and promote education and economic development. Mecklenburg County's library system offers books and e-books, music and videos, homework assistance, and a variety of programs and activities for all ages, from story time to writing contests to job and technology training programs. In addition, the computers, internet and printers found at the library are a critical resource for users who lack these technological resources at home.

#### How are we doing?
In fiscal year 2020, the 20 library locations in Mecklenburg County were visited over 2.5 million times and lent over 5.6 million items. The Charlotte Mecklenburg Library websites were visited more than 22 million times, and over two million digital items were downloaded. The number of library card holders shows a steady increase from 228,577 in 2016 to 234,087 in 2018. 

#### Did you know?
The Library encourages the love of reading and learning by offering 22,137 programs with a total attendance of 464,594 in fiscal year 2020. The Library has also made a committment to partner with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools to expand literacy programming for pre-third grade students.
